Our program will be compiled using the following command in terminal: javac *.java.
This will only work when the command is run from the src folder.
To run the program: type "java Main" followed by pressing enter in terminal.


To use this program, the first thing you have to do is "pick a player"
that will be your team for the game. This will appear in the terminal (intelliJ terminal) or macOS terminal.
