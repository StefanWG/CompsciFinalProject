Our program will be compiled using the following command in terminal: "javac *.java".
This will only work when the command is run from the src folder.
To run the program: type "java Main" followed by pressing enter in terminal.


To use this program, the first thing you have to do is "pick a player."
that will be your team for the game. This will appear in the terminal (intelliJ terminal) or macOS terminal.
After you follow the directions (type an int between 1 and 4), go back to the popup screen to play the game.
When the Home team is batting (you!) the meter will be going back and forth. To stop it, press the space bar.
Once you stop the first meter (the contact meter which is on the left) stop the other one (on the right, power meter).
The goal is to stop the meter in the center of the bar.
The system will then flash your at bat result (single, double, out, etc.) and update bases (top right).
The scoreboard will also update. Your outs for the current inning are displayed inside the bases.
Other than that, everything works like a normal baseball game.

Have fun and Good Luck!
