Our program is compiled by using the following command in terminal: "javac *.java".
This will only work when the command is run from the src folder.
To run the program: type "java Main" followed by pressing enter in terminal.

To use this program, the first thing you have to do is pick a team.
Then, you get to decide if you want to play a single game or enter season mode.

If you choose single player, when the Home team is batting (you!) the meter will be going back and forth.
To stop it, press the space bar. Once you stop the first meter (the contact meter which is on the left),
stop the other one (on the right, power meter). The goal is to stop the meter in the center of the bar.
The system will then flash your at bat result (single, double, out, etc.) and update bases (top right).
The scoreboard will also update. Your outs for the current inning are displayed inside the bases.
Other than that, everything works like a normal 9-inning baseball game.

If you choose season mode, you will have the option to simulate a game or play it. If you play it,
it works the same way as above, although you may be the away team. Scroll down for the complete
standings and schedule.

Press Command+M to mute.
Press Command+E to end game.
Press Command+N for a new game.
Press Command+P to pick a new team.
Note: These don't work yet for season mode.

Have fun and Good Luck!
