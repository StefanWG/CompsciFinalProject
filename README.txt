Our program is compiled by using the following command in terminal: "javac *.java".
This will only work when the command is run from the src folder.
To run the program: type "java Main" followed by pressing enter in terminal.
Note: The JFrame takes a few second to load when you run it.

To use this program, the first thing you have to do is pick a team.
Then, you get to decide if you want to play a single game or enter season mode.
Remember, the state of your game or season will not be saved if you quit the game, so be careful.

When your team is at bat, you will see a meter labeled "C" with a bar moving back and forth.
Your goal is to stop the bar, by pressing the spacebar, as close to the center as possible,
or at least in the green. The same will happen with the meter labeled "P". Using the results
from the contact meter and the power meter along with the ratings of player at bat, the computer
will determine the outcome.
Other than that, everything works like a normal 9-inning baseball game. You can see the score,
the number outs, where the base runners are on the top part of your screen. You can see who is hitting
and the next two batters on the right. By click the "Rules" button on the bottom right, you can see the
the rules.

Single Game:
If you choose to play a single game, you will always be the home team. Once the game ends you will
be able to see the boxscore.

Season Mode:
You will be taken to the home screen for season mode. Scroll down for the complete standings and schedule.
For each game, you can simulate it or play it and all the other games will be simulated. You will be both the
home team and the away team over the course of the season.
Note: Nothing happens when the season ends, so you will have to use one of the commands (below).


Press Command+M to mute or unmute the game.
Press Command+E to end the game (the end of the game will be simulated).
Press Command+C to pick a new team (this will end the game or the season).

Have fun and Good Luck!
